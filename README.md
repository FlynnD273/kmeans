# K-Means

Just a quick project to try out the p5.js library and make a K-means clustering algorithm. It's pretty simple, it just calculates the clustering for n points and if the ratio between the area of the smallest and largest clusters is too large, it'll increase n by 1. 

Next steps would probably be to merge clusters if they're too dense and make a smarter splitting threshold algorithm.
